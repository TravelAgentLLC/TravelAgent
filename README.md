# Important Things to note
1. the location that u fly out from is the location of the server(ie. i live in stl so when i run the app on my pc all flights are gotten from stl)
2. not being specfic enough with a location will cause an error ex. if u select a state the app will crash select a city it probably wont look at the google flights site and type in hawaii and the type in miami u will see why this crashes the app
3. putting dates that are to far in the future will also crash the app trying to find flights for august 2024 will not work there is no flights
4. if the location u choose is in the middle of nowhere it will crash since there is nothing there
