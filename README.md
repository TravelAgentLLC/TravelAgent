Travel Agent App
test
# Important Things to note
1. the location that u fly out from is the location of the server(ie. i live in stl so when i run the app on my pc all flights are gotten from stl)
2. not being specfic enough with a location will cause an error ex. if u select a state the app will crash select a city it probably wont look at the google flights site and type in hawaii and the type in miami u will see why this crashes the app
3. putting dates that are to far in the future will also crash the app trying to find flights for august 2024 will not work there is no flights
4. if the location u choose is in the middle of nowhere it will crash since there is nothing there
# theres lots to do
1. our backend can be a little faster
2. userPage does not refresh when items are delted
3. users can input whatever they want in the input boxes which can cause erros it also doesnt even say what the format should be
4. if u get to the end of the dialouge the app crashes
5. we tried to make out text animated but it only works on the first call and it looks a bit strange
6. our backend has negative error handaling the front end should probably not crash when errors happen and should let the user know what went wrong
7. we made sure adding more dialogue is easy so go crazy if you wanna expand the lore
